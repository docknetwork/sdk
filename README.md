# `Dock` SDK monorepository

Features five packages, such as

- [`@docknetwork/credential-sdk`](./packages/credential-sdk) - An API-agnostic Javascript library for working with Verifiable Credentials, DIDs, Claim Deduction, and more.
- [`@docknetwork/dock-blockchain-api`](./packages/dock-blockchain-api) - A Javascript library built with PolkadotJS, for use with the [Dock Substrate Node](https://github.com/docknetwork/dock-substrate) or our public main/test networks.
- [`@docknetwork/dock-blockchain-modules`](./packages/dock-blockchain-modules) - A JavaScript library designed for handling credential SDK elements (DIDS, Accumulators, etc) on the Dock blockchain.
- [`@docknetwork/cheqd-blockchain-api`](./packages/cheqd-blockchain-api) - A Javascript library built atop of `@cheqd/sdk` that allows to interact with the `Cheqd` blockchain.
- [`@docknetwork/cheqd-blockchain-modules`](./packages/cheqd-blockchain-modules) - A JavaScript library created for managing credential SDK components such as DIDs and accumulators etc on the Cheqd blockchain.

You are welcome to explore the [tutorials](./tutorials) and [examples](./examples) to get a basic understanding.

In essence, the architecture is structured as follows:

- The fundamentals of VC, including types, cryptography, and abstract modules, are housed in `@docknetwork/credential-sdk`.
- Specific implementations for the `Dock` and `Cheqd` blockchain modules can be found in `@docknetwork/dock-blockchain-modules` and `@docknetwork/cheqd-blockchain-modules`, respectively.
- Basic blockchain connectors for the `Dock` and `Cheqd` blockchain are available through `@docknetwork/dock-blockchain-api` and `@docknetwork/cheqd-blockchain-api`.
