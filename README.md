# Dock Client SDK

A JavaScript SDK built ontop of PolkadotJS for interaction with the Dock Substrate node and testnet.

## Install or build
- Run `yarn add @docknetwork/sdk` or `npm install @docknetwork/sdk` to install the package from npm
- When building from source:
    - Run `yarn` to install the dependencies
    - Run `yarn build` to create a distribution version.

## Documentation
Have a look at the [concepts and tutorials](https://docknetwork.github.io/sdk/tutorials). These are generated from markdown
present over [here](./tutorials/src). Files prefixed with `concepts` describe the concepts and files prefixed with
`tutorials` have a tutorial on using the API.

## Examples
The example scripts present in [example directory](./example) are meant to demonstrate a complete feature. The following
commands demonstrate different features.
- Run example to create a new DID, register it, update its key and remove the DID.
    ```
    yarn dock-did-example
    ```

- Run example to resolve DID
    ```
    yarn did-resolver-example
    ```

- Run example to see revocation
    ```
    yarn revocation-example
    ```

- Run example to see verifiable credentials
    ```
    yarn vcdm-example
    ```

## Connecting
Use Dock's substrate node: https://github.com/docknetwork/dock-substrate

Running dev node:
```
./target/release/dock-testnet --base-path /tmp/alice --chain local --alice --port 30333 --ws-port 9944 --rpc-port 9933 --telemetry-url ws://telemetry.polkadot.io:1024 --validator --dev
```

## Test and example Configuration
Configuration variables like websocket endpoint for node `FullNodeEndpoint`, URI for account to pay for extrinsics `TestAccountURI`
and keyring type `TestKeyringType` can be set as environment variables (or in an .env file). If they are not set, default values as
specified in file [test-constants.js](./tests/test-constants.js) are used.

## Test

Run unit tests with `yarn test`.

Run e2e integrations tests with `yarn test-integration` (required node to be running)

You can run tests against a temporary node in docker like so:

```
./scripts/checkout_submodule
yarn test-with-node
```

Run a single test module with `yarn test <module name or prefix>`.

## Lint
`yarn lint --fix`

## JSON types
The types on Substrate node should be reflected in [types.json](./src/types.json)
